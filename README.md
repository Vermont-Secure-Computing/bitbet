# bitbet


This is an open source decentralized version of the classic "Bitbet" site which was popular a decade ago.  

see e.g. https://web.archive.org/web/20140625044433/http://bitbet.us/


Renamed to SolBetX, now launched on Solana Mainnet and Devnet 
(run the front end locally on your machine or use :  solbetx.com    devnet.solbetx.com)  


In this Solana-only version, all bets, resolutions, and payouts are performed by the smart contract deployed on the Solana network. 
There is no custodian or company managing the funds or the platform.  

The contract is verified by Solana network to match the code in this repo, and not upgradeable.

The Solana network oracle used to resolve bets is the Truth-It network (truth.it.com;  https://github.com/Vermont-Secure-Computing/truth-net)

Thanks to all contributors!  

Please read the instructions before interacting with the SolbetX contract.  There are no guarantees of any kind. 
Contributors to this open source software project have no responsibility for any actions taken by those using the contract, 
nor for consequences thereof. 

Gambling can be addictive.  Please play responsibly!
